# Configuration
This configuration is my personal laptop/desktop configuration repo inspired by: http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/ and it's for myself to quickly setup commandline environment (mainly on Centos and Mac, there are some other OS' stuff too!).

# Create symlink for all dotfiles
Simply do: cd && git clone https://github.com/zedai1984/dotfiles.git .dotfiles && cd .dotfiles && ./createSymlink.sh

# Install Centos
sudo installCentos7(Term/Desktop).sh
